# 02-Challenge
Second assignment

This is the start of our professional portfolio. We want a start for where we will collect our assignments and projects. This is so any potential employer can evaluate these samples and see if I’m a good fit for the position. On load you can see my name and a ‘hero’ image placeholder. At this time, I do not have any good portrait photo to upload to the class, this will be fixed before it is time to apply for positions. My about me comes out sounding too casual. To fix this I am just using the filler text to help with spacing until I can create a professional About Me. This will be updated in the same timeframe as the hero image. I have a section for sample projects. At the moment, I do not have any projects to add to this site, so the links just open blank tabs. Once projects are able to be added, the projects will be added. My contact info can be found above the foot of the page.
